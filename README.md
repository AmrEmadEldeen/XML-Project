## Idea of project

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing
information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse
such files and do some basic operations. In this project, you will work on developing a GUI
(Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file.

In our system the XML file will represent users in a social network
Each user has id (unique), name, list of posts, list of followers.
Each post has text and list of topics.


## The project supports these Features:

* A GUI in which the user can specify the location of an input XML file.

* Checking the XML consistency: if the input XML have inconsistencies like missing any of the closing and opening tags or not matching tags, The program will be able to automatically solve the errors. 

* Formatting (Prettifying) the XML: the XML file will be formatted by keeping the indentation for each level.

* Converting XML to JSON 

* Minifying the XML file

* Compressing XML/JSON File

* Decompressing XML/JSON File
